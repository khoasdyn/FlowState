# FlowState: project documentation

## What this app does

FlowState is a macOS productivity app built entirely with SwiftUI. It combines a Pomodoro-style focus timer with a website blocker that prevents users from visiting distracting websites while a focus session is active. When the timer is running and the user navigates to a blocked website in their browser, the app automatically redirects the tab to a local "blocked" HTML page bundled inside the app.

The app lives primarily in the macOS menu bar, giving the user quick access to start, pause, and stop focus sessions without switching away from their work. A main window provides a full UI for managing blocked websites, selecting focus categories, and controlling the timer.

## How the website blocking works

### The approach: Apple Events

FlowState uses **Apple Events** to control web browsers. Apple Events are macOS's built-in inter-process communication system that allows one application to send commands to another. AppleScript is the human-readable scripting language built on top of Apple Events, but any macOS app can send them programmatically using `NSAppleScript` from Swift.

The key insight is that major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera, Arc) expose a **scripting dictionary** — a set of commands they respond to via Apple Events. These commands include reading the URL of any tab and setting it to a new value. This means an external app can ask Chrome "what URL is your active tab showing?" and then tell it "change that tab's URL to this local file instead."

### The blocking flow

The blocking mechanism follows this sequence, repeated on a timer while a focus session is active:

1. The app's timer fires at a regular interval (currently every 1 second, tied to the countdown timer).
2. The app constructs an AppleScript string that asks the browser for the URL of its active tab.
3. The app executes this script using `NSAppleScript`, which sends Apple Events to the browser and receives the URL back.
4. The app compares the returned URL against the user's blocklist using simple substring matching (`currentURL.contains(blockedDomain)`).
5. If a match is found, the app constructs a second AppleScript string that tells the browser to set the active tab's URL to a local HTML file bundled in the app at `Resources/BlockPage.html`.
6. The browser navigates the tab to the block page, effectively replacing the distracting website.

### What the user sees

When the user first launches FlowState and triggers a browser check, macOS shows a system dialog:

> "FlowState wants access to control [Browser Name]. Allowing control will provide access to documents and data in [Browser Name], and to perform actions within that app."

This is the standard macOS **Automation permission** prompt. The user must click "Allow" for the blocking to work with that browser. This permission is granted per-browser and persists across app launches. It can be managed in **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation**.

Once granted, the blocking operates silently in the background with no further prompts.

### Why this approach was chosen

This approach requires no special entitlements from Apple, no VPN profiles, no system configuration changes, and no browser extensions. The app uses only standard macOS APIs available to any developer. It is distributed as a normal macOS app and can be submitted to the Mac App Store with the `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement declared in the entitlements file.

### Known limitations of this approach

**Polling-based, not event-driven.** There is no callback or notification when a browser navigates. The app must continuously poll tab URLs on a timer, meaning there is always a brief delay where the blocked site loads before the redirect kicks in.

**Only works with scriptable browsers.** Firefox does not expose a scripting dictionary and cannot be controlled via Apple Events. Any browser without a scripting dictionary is unsupported.

**Only checks the active tab of the front window.** Background tabs and other windows are not currently monitored.

**User can revoke permission.** The Automation permission can be disabled at any time in System Settings, which silently breaks the blocking.

**Substring matching can over-match.** Blocking "t.co" would also match URLs containing "t.co" as a substring of longer strings like "select.com" because `contains` checks for substrings anywhere in the URL string, not just the domain.

## Color usage rule

All colors in the project must come from the custom color assets defined in `Assets.xcassets/Untitled_ColorStyles`. These asset colors are auto-generated by Xcode as static properties on `Color` and `ShapeStyle`, which means they can be referenced using dot syntax directly without needing to write a manual `Color` extension.

The required syntax is the dot-notation form where the hyphenated asset name is converted to camelCase. For example, the asset named `blue-500` becomes `.blue500`, the asset named `gray-warm-200` becomes `.grayWarm200`, and the asset named `orange-dark-700` becomes `.orangeDark700`. This conversion happens automatically because Xcode strips the hyphens and capitalizes the first letter of each subsequent word when generating the Swift symbol.

When a color is used in a context where the type is already known to be `Color` (such as inside `.foregroundStyle()`, `.background()`, or a property typed as `Color`), use the shorthand dot syntax like `.blue500`. When the type is ambiguous or the color is being assigned in a context where Swift cannot infer the type, use the full form `Color.blue500`.

Do not use SwiftUI system colors like `.blue`, `.red`, `.gray`, `.orange`, `.purple`, `.mint`, or `.yellow`. Do not use the string-based initializer `Color("blue-500")`. Both of these patterns bypass the design system and make the color palette inconsistent across the app.

The `AppConfig.ColorTheme` struct in `AppConfig.swift` defines semantic color aliases (like `primaryText`, `secondaryText`, `secondaryStroke`) that map to specific asset colors. Use these semantic names when referring to standard UI roles, and use the asset colors directly when applying category-specific or decorative colors.

## Codebase overview

### Observation system

The project uses the modern **Observation framework** (`@Observable`) exclusively. All view model classes are marked with `@Observable` and do not conform to `ObservableObject`. The view layer uses `@State` to own the root view model, `@Environment(ViewModel.self)` to read it from the environment, and `.environment(viewModel)` to inject it. Plain `var` properties are used when passing `@Observable` objects as parameters to child views, since the Observation framework tracks property access automatically without any wrapper.

The older Combine-based observation system (`ObservableObject`, `@Published`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject`, `.environmentObject()`) is not used anywhere in the project.

### Key files explained

**`FlowStateApp.swift`** — Defines the `@main` app struct with two scenes: a `WindowGroup` for the main window and a `MenuBarExtra` for the menu bar. The root `ViewModel` is owned here with `@State` and injected into both scenes using `.environment(viewModel)`. Contains `ContentView` which switches between `HomeView` and `SettingView` based on the navigation state. Also subscribes to the timer publisher and syncs the SwiftData blocklist to the view model on every tick.

**`ViewModel.swift`** — The central `@Observable` coordinator that owns all child view models (`CategoryEditViewModel`, `BlockedWebsitesViewModel`, `TimerViewModel`). Holds the app's navigation state (`AppNavigationView`), the timer state (`TimerState`), and the current blocked websites array. All session control flows through this class: `handleTimer()` for the main toggle, plus `startSession()`, `pauseSession()`, `resumeSession()`, `resetSession()`, `addTime()`, and `subtractTime()` for direct control from the menu bar. The `countTime()` method is called every second from ContentView's `.onReceive` and coordinates both the timer tick and website monitoring. Views never call TimerViewModel directly — they always go through ViewModel. Views read this from the environment using `@Environment(ViewModel.self)`.

**`BlockedWebsitesViewModel.swift`** — Contains two things: the `BlockedItem` SwiftData model class (a simple URL string with an ID), and the `BlockedWebsitesViewModel` class that executes AppleScript to read Chrome's active tab URL and redirect it if it matches a blocked domain. The `checkChromeURL(list:)` method is the core blocking function. The `redirectToLocalPage()` method constructs and executes the redirect AppleScript.

**`TimerViewModel.swift`** — A self-contained timer that manages only time values with no reference to its parent. Owns `remainingTime` (the displayed countdown/countup value) and `totalSessionTime` (the original session duration, used to detect overtime). Publishes a 1-second timer via `Timer.publish(every: 1, ...)`. Provides `start()` to capture the session duration, `tick()` to advance one second, `reset()` to return to defaults, and `addTime()`/`subtractTime()` for adjustments. It does not know about app state, navigation, or website blocking — ViewModel calls its methods and makes all decisions.

**`CategoryEditView-ViewModel.swift`** — Manages a list of predefined focus categories (Studying, Deep Work, Creative Work, Coding Session, Working), each with an emoji, title, and color. Tracks which category is currently selected and updates the UI accordingly. Passed to `CategoryEditView` as a plain `var` property (no wrapper needed with `@Observable`).

**`AppConfig.swift`** — Central place for app-wide constants. Currently holds the default Pomodoro time (1500 seconds = 25 minutes) and a `ColorTheme` struct with semantic color references used throughout the UI.

**`BlockPage.html`** — A simple HTML page displayed when a blocked site is detected. Shows a flower SVG, an "Access Denied" heading, and a motivational message. The browser is redirected to this file using a `file://` URL pointing to the app bundle's Resources folder.

### Data flow

```
User taps Start
    → ViewModel.handleTimer()
    → ViewModel.startSession()
        → appState = .running
        → TimerViewModel.start() (captures remainingTime as totalSessionTime)

Every 1 second (timer tick via .onReceive in ContentView):
    → ViewModel.countTime()
        → Guard: only runs if appState == .running
        → ViewModel.monitoring()
            → BlockedWebsitesViewModel.checkChromeURL(list:)
                → NSAppleScript: asks Chrome for active tab URL
                → Compares URL against blockedWebsites array
                → If match: redirectToLocalPage()
                    → NSAppleScript: sets Chrome tab URL to BlockPage.html
        → TimerViewModel.tick()
            → Decrements remainingTime (or increments during overtime)

    → ContentView also copies @Query blockedList to ViewModel.blockedWebsites
      (this is how SwiftData items get passed to the view model layer)
```

The ownership flows strictly downward: views call ViewModel, ViewModel calls TimerViewModel. TimerViewModel never references its parent.

### Data persistence

**SwiftData** is used for the blocked websites list. `BlockedItem` is a `@Model` class with a single `blockedURL` string property. The model container is attached at the app level in `FlowStateApp`. Views that need to read the list use `@Query var blockedList: [BlockedItem]`, and views that need to add or delete items access `@Environment(\.modelContext)`.

**`@AppStorage`** is used for the `showMenuBarExtra` toggle that controls whether the menu bar item appears.

Categories and the selected category are **not persisted** — they reset to defaults on every app launch.

### Navigation

The app uses a simple enum-based navigation system rather than `NavigationStack`. `ViewModel.appNavigationView` holds the current screen as an `AppNavigationView` enum value (`.home` or `.edit`), and `ContentView` switches between `HomeView` and `SettingView` based on this value.

The category selector appears as a `.sheet()` presented from `HomeView`.

### Timer states

The timer has three states defined in the `TimerState` enum:

- **`.idle`** — No session active. Timer shows the default duration (25:00). The user can adjust the time and edit settings.
- **`.running`** — Session active. Timer counts down each second. Website blocking is active. The user can pause or finish.
- **`.paused`** — Session paused. Timer holds its current value. Website blocking stops. The user can resume or finish.

When the timer reaches zero, it enters "overtime" mode: it resets and starts counting up, with the UI showing "Session Ended!" to indicate the planned focus time has elapsed.

### Entitlements

The app declares two entitlements in `FlowState.entitlements`:

- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only` — Allows reading user-selected files (standard for sandboxed apps).
- `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` — Allows sending Apple Events to other applications. This is the critical entitlement that enables the browser control functionality.

### Dependencies

The project has **zero external dependencies**. It uses only Apple's frameworks: SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Foundation (which includes `NSAppleScript`).

## AppleScript commands reference

These are the specific AppleScript commands the app uses to interact with browsers. Each command is constructed as a Swift string and executed via `NSAppleScript(source:)`.

### Reading the active tab URL (Chrome-based browsers)

```applescript
tell application "Google Chrome"
    set currentTabURL to URL of active tab of window 1
end tell
return currentTabURL
```

For other Chromium browsers, replace `"Google Chrome"` with `"Brave Browser"`, `"Microsoft Edge"`, `"Opera"`, or `"Arc"`.

### Reading the active tab URL (Safari)

```applescript
tell application "Safari"
    set currentTabURL to URL of current tab of front window
end tell
return currentTabURL
```

Note: Safari uses `current tab of front window` while Chrome uses `active tab of window 1`. This is because each browser defines its own scripting dictionary with different terminology.

### Redirecting a tab (Chrome-based)

```applescript
tell application "Google Chrome"
    set URL of active tab of window 1 to "file:///path/to/BlockPage.html"
end tell
```

### Redirecting a tab (Safari)

```applescript
tell application "Safari"
    set URL of current tab of front window to "file:///path/to/BlockPage.html"
end tell
```

### Checking all tabs across all windows (not yet implemented)

```applescript
tell application "Google Chrome"
    repeat with w in windows
        repeat with t in tabs of w
            set tabURL to URL of t
            -- check tabURL against blocklist
            -- if matched: set URL of t to blocked page
        end repeat
    end repeat
end tell
```

## Supported browsers

| Browser | Bundle identifier | Scripting dictionary | Tab URL syntax |
|---|---|---|---|
| Safari | com.apple.Safari | Yes | `URL of current tab of front window` |
| Google Chrome | com.google.Chrome | Yes | `URL of active tab of window 1` |
| Brave | com.brave.Browser | Yes | Same as Chrome |
| Microsoft Edge | com.microsoft.edgemac | Yes | Same as Chrome |
| Opera | com.operasoftware.Opera | Yes | Same as Chrome |
| Arc | company.thebrowser.Browser | Yes | Same as Chrome |
| Firefox | org.mozilla.firefox | No | Not scriptable via Apple Events |

All Chromium-based browsers share the same scripting dictionary structure inherited from Chrome. Safari has its own distinct scripting dictionary.

## Glossary

**Apple Events** — A macOS inter-process communication mechanism that allows one application to send commands to another. It is the low-level system that AppleScript is built on top of.

**AppleScript** — A scripting language for macOS that provides a human-readable syntax for sending Apple Events. In this project, AppleScript strings are constructed in Swift and executed using `NSAppleScript`.

**`NSAppleScript`** — A Foundation class that compiles and executes AppleScript source code at runtime from within a Swift application. Returns results as `NSAppleEventDescriptor` objects.

**Scripting dictionary (sdef)** — An XML file bundled inside an application that defines what Apple Events it responds to. Browsers that include a scripting dictionary can be queried and controlled by external apps. Browsers without one (like Firefox) cannot.

**Automation permission** — A macOS privacy protection that requires the user to explicitly grant one app permission to send Apple Events to another app. Managed in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation.

**Polling** — A technique where the app repeatedly checks (polls) the browser's state on a timer, as opposed to event-driven approaches where the browser would notify the app of changes. Polling always introduces a delay between the event (user visiting a blocked site) and the response (redirect).

**SwiftData** — Apple's modern framework for data persistence in Swift apps, used here to store the list of blocked website domains.

**`@Model`** — A SwiftData macro that marks a class as a persistent data model, automatically generating the schema and storage logic.

**`@Observable`** — A Swift macro (from the Observation framework) that enables fine-grained property tracking for SwiftUI views. When a view reads a property from an `@Observable` object, SwiftUI automatically re-renders only when that specific property changes. This is the only observation system used in this project.

**`MenuBarExtra`** — A SwiftUI Scene type that creates a menu bar item with a dropdown panel. Used here to give the user quick access to session controls without opening the main window.
